In this notebook, we'll explore how to learn node representations on a graph using graph convolution techniques—essentially applying machine learning directly on graph structures.
We'll be working with the CoraGraphDataset from https://graphsandnetworks.com/the-cora-dataset/. According to the source, the dataset includes 2,708 scientific papers categorized into seven classes, with a citation network comprising 5,429 directed edges. Each paper is represented by a binary feature vector of length 1,433, where each index indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of a specific word from a predefined dictionary.
This setup creates a 2,708 x 2,708 adjacency matrix, where an entry exists only if a paper (at the row index) cites another paper (at the column index), forming a directed edge. Because citations move in one direction—from citing to cited—this graph is directional and likely acyclic, though the presence of cycles doesn't impact our analysis. Each node represents a publication, and edges reflect citation relationships.
